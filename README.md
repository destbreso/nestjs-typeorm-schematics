### Overview

This package contains a set of [NestJS CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview) schematics for generating custom resources for a nestjs project using typeorm persistent layer
  * `crud`: fully functional and swagger integrated CRUD module.


> **TRHANKS!**: This solution is inspired in [this article](https://dev.to/nestjs/advanced-nestjs-how-to-build-completely-dynamic-nestjs-modules-1370), and [this](https://github.com/Comerick/Nestjs-template-schematics.git), and [this](https://github.com/nestjsplus/dyn-schematics) repos

See [below](#dynamic-package-generation) for a description of the use cases.

### Installation

Install the package as **dev** dependencies below.  Due to the implementation of the NestJS CLI, the package **can be** **global** or **dev**.

```bash
npm install -D @guachos/nestjs-typeorm-schematics
```

or

```bash
yarn add -D @guachos/nestjs-typeorm-schematics
```

### Dependencies

The generated code uses some of the public libraries of the `@guachos` development ecosystem:

* `@guachos/api-core`
* `@guachos/nestjs-common`
* `@guachos/nestjs-typeorm-data-access`
* `@guachos/nestjs-typeorm-meta-mapper`
* `@guachos/nestjs-api-response`


> **NOTE**: some of these libraries are currently maintained in private repos, so this solution is not fully open source...for now
>

### Resources Generation

Currently, there is only one case supported, with a corresponding schematic:

1. Adding a generated CRUD module *to an existing NestJS project*. In this case, the module is created in its own folder, and is wired into the existing project using appropriate module metadata, includes, etc.  This schematic works much like Nest's built-in `module` schematic but creates a fully implemented *CRUD module with Swagger integration* and this schematic is based on generated entities.

### Nest CLI

These schematics are built on top of the [Nest CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages) infrastructure, so their usage is exactly as documented on that page.

> Note: since these schematics are built on top of the Nest CLI, all of the optional arguments (such as specifying an optional path in which to generate the code) and options (such as `--dry-run`, `--flat`) are available.  Currently, however, the schematics always  generate spec files.
<!-- 
### Use-case #1: Generating a standalone package

The following step will create a new folder using `<pkg-name>`, which will contain the standalone package files and folders for your new dynamic module package.

#### Verify generated package

If you answered `yes` to the prompt `Generate a testing client?`, a small testing module was automatically generated called `<pkg-name>ClientModule`.  You can test that the template was properly generated by running:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  Your browser should display `Hello from <pkg-name>Module!`.

#### Optionally publish package

The `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` files are generated according to the process described [in this article](https://dev.to/nestjs/publishing-nestjs-packages-with-npm-21fm).  This means that publishing the package to npm is as simple as:
1. updating the `package.json` with your author information, etc.
2. running `npm publish`

See [the npm packaging](https://dev.to/nestjs/publishing-nestjs-packages-with-npm-21fm) article for more information. -->

#### Use the `crud` schematic

```bash
npx nest g -c @guachos/nestjs-typeorm-schematics crud <module-name> <destination-path>
```

- `crud` is the name of the schematic used to generate a new CRUD module (which will be added to your existing project).
- `<module-name>` is the name of the new module you're building.
- `<destination-path>` is the path where the new module will be generated

> **TIP:** You can simply type `nest g -c @guachos/nestjs-typeorm-schematics crud` and follow the prompt instructions

The schematic adds the new module in a folder named `<module-name>`.  Just like using the built-in module schematic (e.g., `nest g module myNewModule`), this will add the generated module to the imports list of your root module with the appropriate metadata and includes.  At this point, you can customize the generated module as needed.

<!-- ### Customizing
